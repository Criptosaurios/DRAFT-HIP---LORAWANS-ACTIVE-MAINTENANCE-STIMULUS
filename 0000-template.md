# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This HIP proposes to reward those who have supported the current growth of HELIUM (Hotspot Owners, Validators and the top 20 richest HNT Wallets) 
and provide additional encouragement to continue exercising that FUNDAMENTAL ROLE of support as they have done so far.
  
# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Together, owners of Hotspots, Validators and investors in HNT, have made what is now Helium, and through this paid NFT it is intended to reward their support.
We also want to prevent the current size of the LORA network from being reduced and putting at risk the deployment of IOT devices that will finally 
provide the Data Credit for the support and maintenance of the Hotspots in the long term.
  The implementation of HIP51 is a growth opportunity for Helium, but it also represents a threat to the incentive to continue participating in LORA, 
since the growth in the consumption of Data Credits will be much higher and much faster in the 5G subDAO and the WIFI subDAO, since the devices that are 
going to consume the Data Credits of these subDAOs ARE ALREADY in the hands of millions of people (Cell Phones).
  The LORA network has a bright future, but it needs a little more time for the deployment of devices that Will use the network to make it self-sustaining 
based only on Data Credits.
  It is clear that the new subDAOs come to Helium because the only ecosystem that can support them and accelerate their growth exists here,  
  as happened with LORA.

# Stakeholders
[stakeholders]: #stakeholders

* All ACTIVE Hotspots until the moment of capture (Snapshot). Hotspots that are activated after the capture will NOT be eligible.
* All Validators ACTIVE until the moment of capture (Snapshot). Validators that are activated or created after capture will NOT be eligible.
* The top 20 richest wallets in HNT at the time of capture (Snapshot). Wallets that advance to the top 20 after capture will NOT be eligible.
  
# Detailed Explanation
[detailed-explanation]: #detailed-explanation

This HIP proposes taking a snapshot, one day before the remuneration in IOT begins in the LORA subDAO, established preliminarily on August 1st according to HIP51.
This Snapshot applies to:
* ACTIVE hotspots (those with valid activity in the last 30 days): Each wallet will receive ONE NFT FOR EACH HOTSPOT that effectively participated in the capture.  
* ACTIVE Validator Nodes: Each active validator node (and with the latest updated software version) at the time of sanpshot will receive ONE NFT.
* The top 20 richest wallets in HNT: Each of the top 20 richest wallets in HNT at the time of the snapshot will receive ONE NFT.
  
This proposal establishes that each subDAO that is incorporated into HELIUM after the approval of HIP51, must contribute 15% of the issuance of its tokens 
(DNT) to assign rewards to NFTs in the following way:  
 5% will be distributed among the NFTs assigned to Hotspots.
 5% Will be distributed among the NFTs assigned to Validators.
 5% will be distributed among the NFTs assigned to the 20 richest wallets in HNT.
  
 This proposal also establishes the conditions for each NFT to be eligible to receive the reward in each eapoch: 
Hotspots NFT: The Hotspot associated with the NFT must be active in order to participate in the reward distribution. The 5% reward will be shared only 
among NFTs that meet this requirement.  
  
NFT of Validator Nodes: The Validator associated with the NFT must be active and updated in order to participate in the reward distribution. The 5%   
reward will be shared only among NFTs that meet this requirement.
  
NFT of the 20 richest wallets in HNT: The Wallet associated with the NFT must maintain at least 75% of the balance registered in the capture in order 
to participate in the reward distribution. The 5% reward will be shared only among NFTs that meet this requirement.  


# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

- It is necessary to modify the tokemonic that is being considered in HIP51 to 53 and HIP64

# Rationale and Alternatives
[alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

Allow a new Hotspot to be associated in the future to replace the existing one associated with the NFT.
Thus, there could be an evolution of the Hotspot hardware without losing the incentive for the current minimum size of the network.

# Unresolved Questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

Is there a simpler and safer mechanism than NFTs for the purposes of this proposal?


# Deployment Impact
[deployment-impact]: #deployment-impact

This FounderÂ´s NFT reward system will motivate to keep at least the current LORA network size.


 # Success Metrics
[success-metrics]: #success-metrics

We can expect a surge in Hotspots deployment previous to the snapshot, and after snapshot we can expect that at least Hotspots captured in snapshot will continue active

Top 20 richest wallets will get an extra incentive to keep at least 75% of their balance at the snapshot.
  
Validators will get and extra incentive to keep their nodes updated at each epoch.
